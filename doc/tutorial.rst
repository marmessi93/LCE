LCE Presentation
================
**Local Cascade Ensemble (LCE)** proposes to answer the recurrent question faced by data science practitioners: **Random Forest or XGBoost**?

LCE combines their strengths and adopts a complementary diversification approach to obtain a better generalizing predictor. 
Thus, LCE further enhances the prediction performance of both Random Forest and XGBoost.

Overview
--------
The construction of an ensemble method involves combining accurate and diverse individual predictors. 
There are **two complementary ways** to generate diverse predictors: *(i)* by **changing the training data distribution** and *(ii)* by **learning different parts of the training data**.

**LCE adopts these two diversification approaches.** 
First, *(i)* LCE combines the two well-known methods that modify the distribution of the original training data with complementary effects on the bias-variance trade-off: bagging [1]_ (variance reduction) and boosting [2]_ (bias reduction). 
Then, *(ii)* LCE learns different parts of the training data to capture new relationships that cannot be discovered globally based on a divide-and-conquer strategy (a decision tree). 
Before detailing how LCE combines these methods, we introduce the key concepts behind them that will be used in the explanation of LCE.

Concepts
--------
The bias-variance trade-off defines the capacity of the learning algorithm to generalize beyond the training set. 
The *bias* is the component of the prediction error that results from systematic errors of the learning algorithm. 
A high bias means that the learning algorithm is not able to capture the underlying structure of the training set (underfitting). 
The *variance* measures the sensitivity of the learning algorithm to changes in the training set. 
A high variance means that the algorithm is learning too closely the training set (overfitting). 
The objective is to minimize both the bias and variance. *Bagging* has a main effect on variance reduction; it is a method for generating multiple versions of a predictor (bootstrap replicates) and using these to get an aggregated predictor. 
The current state-of-the-art method that employs bagging is Random Forest [3]_. 
Whereas, *boosting* has a main effect on bias reduction; it is a method for iteratively learning weak predictors and adding them to create a final strong one. 
After a weak learner is added, the data weights are readjusted, allowing future weak learners to focus more on the examples that previous weak learners mispredicted. 
The current state-of-the-art method that uses boosting is XGBoost [4]_. 
The following Figure illustrates the difference between bagging and boosting methods.

LCE 
---
LCE combines a boosting-bagging approach to handle the bias-variance trade-off faced by machine learning models; in addition, it adopts a divide-and-conquer approach to individualize predictor errors on different parts of the training data. 
LCE is represented in the following Figure.

Specifically, LCE is based on cascade generalization: it uses a set of predictors sequentially, and adds new attributes to the input dataset at each stage. 
The new attributes are derived from the output given by a predictor (e.g., class probabilities for a classifier), called a base learner. 
LCE applies cascade generalization locally following a divide-and-conquer strategy - a decision tree, and reduces bias across a decision tree through the use of boosting-based predictors as base learners. 
The current best performing state-of-the-art boosting algorithm is adopted as base learner (XGBoost, e.g., XGB¹°, XGB¹¹ in above Figure). 
When growing the tree, boosting is propagated down the tree by adding the output of the base learner at each decision node as new attributes to the dataset (e.g., XGB¹°(D¹) in above Figure). 
Prediction outputs indicate the ability of the base learner to correctly predict a sample. 
At the next tree level, the outputs added to the dataset are exploited by the base learner as a weighting scheme to focus more on previously mispredicted samples. 
Then, the overfitting generated by the boosted decision tree is mitigated by the use of bagging. 
Bagging provides variance reduction by creating multiple predictors from random sampling with replacement of the original dataset (e.g., D¹, D² in above Figure). 
Finally, trees are aggregated with a simple majority vote. 
In order to be applied as a predictor, LCE stores, in each node, the model generated by the base learner.

Missing Data
------------
LCE natively handles missing data. 
Similar to XGBoost, LCE excludes missing values for the split and uses block propagation. 
During a node split, block propagation sends all samples with missing data to the side of the decision node with less errors.

Hyperparameters
---------------
The hyperparameters of LCE are the classical ones in tree-based learning (e.g., ``max_depth``, ``max_features``, ``n_estimators``). 
Moreover, LCE learns a specific XGBoost model at each node of a tree, and it only requires the ranges of XGBoost hyperparameters to be specified. 
Then, the hyperparameters of each XGBoost model are automatically set by Hyperopt [5]_, a sequential model-based optimization using a tree of Parzen estimators algorithm. 
Hyperopt chooses the next hyperparameters from both the previous choices and a tree-based optimization algorithm. 
Tree of Parzen estimators meet or exceed grid search and random search performance for hyperparameters setting. 
The full list of LCE hyperparameters is available in its :ref:`API documentation <APIDocumentation>`.

Published Results
-----------------
LCE has been initially designed for a specific application in [6]_, and then evaluated it on the public UCI datasets [7]_ in [8]_. 
Results show that LCE obtains on average a better prediction performance than the state-of-the-art classifiers, including Random Forest and XGBoost.
